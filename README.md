# yacdslib - Yet Another C Data Structure Library

This project is just meant for satisfying my personal curiosity of learning to
program in C. 

Instead of just creating on-the-go a bunch of random poorly-tested C executables,
to push myself a bit harder I've decided to create a *proper* library, paying attention
to creating a reasonable API and writing automated unit tests.

And what a better way to do that than by implementing a bunch of beloved data structures
like linked lists, dynamic arrays, hash maps, and so on.

If don't guarantee an absence of poor design decisions, lack of idiomatic taste and 
other reprehensible flaws; but who cares, it's about the journey.
